    "\n",
    "Text classification and text mining tasks are essential in transforming unstructured text data into structured information for analysis and decision-making. One interesting task within this domain is \"Intent Detection.\" Intent detection involves automatically identifying the underlying goals or purposes of a given text, which can be invaluable in various applications, such as customer support, marketing, and chatbots. In this assignment, I will discuss the features that can be useful for building a machine learning model for intent detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Word2Vec Features**: Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec, capture semantic relationships between words. By representing words in a continuous vector space, these features can help the model understand the context and meaning of words within a text. For intent detection, Word2Vec features can be instrumental in recognizing similarities and associations between different phrases or keywords, aiding in the classification of text into specific intents.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linguistic Feature Extraction**: Linguistic features encompass various aspects of language, including parts of speech, syntactic structures, and grammatical patterns. These features can provide valuable information about the syntactical and grammatical characteristics of the text. For example, identifying the presence of verbs, nouns, or specific grammatical constructs can assist in determining the intent behind a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dependency Parse**: Dependency parsing involves analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence by identifying the relationships between words, such as subject-verb-object dependencies. Utilizing dependency parse features can help the model understand the underlying structure and semantics of a sentence, aiding in the classification of intent. For instance, recognizing that \"buy\" is related to \"product\" in a sentence can suggest an intent related to purchasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: TF-IDF is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a word within a document relative to a corpus of documents. It can be helpful in identifying keywords or phrases that are highly indicative of specific intents. Words with high TF-IDF scores are likely to be significant in determining the intent of a text. For instance, in a customer support context, the presence of words like \"refund\" or \"complaint\" with high TF-IDF scores may suggest an intent related to issue resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Entity Features**: Entities represent specific named objects or concepts, such as names of products, locations, or dates. Recognizing and extracting entities from text can be crucial for intent detection. For example, if a text mentions \"booking a flight to New York on December 1st,\" identifying entities like \"New York\" and \"December 1st\" can help classify the intent as travel planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, building a machine learning model for intent detection requires a combination of diverse features to effectively capture the nuances of human language and context. Word2Vec features offer semantic understanding, linguistic features provide grammatical insights, dependency parse reveals sentence structure, TF-IDF identifies important keywords, and entity recognition pinpoints specific entities. By incorporating these features, the model can robustly classify text into meaningful intents, enabling businesses to streamline processes and provide more efficient services to customers."

      "Rank 1: I went in to see this because of positive RT scores and comments which said this movie reeked of action. The reviewers just left out the part where they were supposed to say the action was unbelievable. It is worth a watch if you have 2.5 hours to kill.The fight choreography between SRK and 'Jim' (I'm too tired to look up the actor's name) were exceptional. Those featuring Padukone were kind of hit and miss. Sometime they reached Marvel's Black Widow heights, other times they were almost laughable.Jim was a good villain. His backstory was touching and you could empathize with him and the reasons that he was doing what he was doing. I couldn't root for him because you already know how the story is going to end but you just don't know how they will get there.Finally, the soundtrack (or background music). It was repetitive when there was a fight between the protagonist and antagonist. So much so that I found it irritating after a while. (Similarity: 0.6896)\n",

      "Rank 3: As a part of the audience, I feel that I just have to write this review, as unfortunate as it may be. I watched Pathaan with my family and there were multiple scenes that were just inappropriate and unnecessary. Other than that, the plot was super unclear and I didn't understand why a virus was brought into it. I thought we would be seeing something new, as there are many films from the past that have this same trope of a deadly virus. The movie was 2 hrs and 30 minutes approximately, quite a long film but I don't understand why everything in the film, every sequence, felt rushed and like it didn't make much sense. I also found the CGI and VFX extremely fake and artificial, which was disappointing. I know that a team and actors worked really hard to make this film as they do others, but I feel that Pathaan just took advantage of the fact that there were stars like SRK, Deepika, John Abraham, and Salman Khan in it. Would you genuinely enjoy the film had it been some other actors? Anyway, I do feel like I had my hopes up too high for this film. I just hope that Bollywood can make good films again soon. (Similarity: 0.6723)\n",
      "Rank 4: Movies like Pathaan are watched primarily for entertainment and if they have a good story as well, then it's a bonus; Pathaan unfortunately falls short on both counts. It feels as if the director and writer decided to throw in a lot of things in the screenplay so as to keep the viewers intrigued, but the problem with this approach is that the screenplay comes across as fragmented; there is a lot going on in the film and yet you feel like nothing much is happening in it. The director has focused more on the action and spectacle part, maybe because Shahrukh Khan wanted his return to be larger than life, but the thing is that all spectacles come across as hollow and meaningless unless they are backed by good storytelling. In movies like Pathaan, we are not supposed to think too much, because that will leave us with multiple questions with no answers; like why didn't the alarms go off as soon as Pathaan and Rubina crashed into the Woskwich Tower or why didn't anyone check the scientists dressed in white after they returned from an investigation towards the end, how is it that no one recognized Pathaan and Rubina despite their faces being clearly visible inside the helmet. Things just happen as per convenience in these kind of films and you are just expected to go with the flow. Pathaan has turned out to be a massive blockbuster, people have loved the comeback of Shah Rukh Khan, but that doesn't change the fact that it's not really a good film.The spy movies coming out of YRF (Yashraj Films) like Tiger Zinda Hai and War have been doing quite well and the production quality always goes up with every new release, which puts forth the question as to why was the CGI of Pathaan so bad? In 'War', I was shocked to realize that a number of scenes which I thought were shot on real locations were actually filmed on a green screen, that's how good the visual effects were in that film. 'War' had some of the cleanest VFX sequences you would come across in an Indian film. In 'Pathaan' on the other hand, one could easily make out if the scene was filmed on a green screen, and it looked quite bad. The whole train sequence where Pathaan and Tiger are fighting on a train felt like a sequence from the 80's when VFX technology did not exist in India. Yashraj Films is a top tier production house and Pathaan wasn't released in a rush, so why couldn't they fix the visual effects of the film?The character Rubina Mohsin played by Deepika Padukone doesn't make much sense and It almost feels like they just wanted to tick a few boxes by adding her to the story. How is it that Rubina, an ISI agent, was unaware of ISI's plan to attack India using Jim? Was General Qadir, an ISI officer, working on his own? Are we supposed to believe that General Qadir was so rich that he could pay up Outfit X all on his own? Obviously, that wasn't the case and ISI was well aware of Jim's plans, so how come they forgot to inform Rubina about it? Also, when Rubina left Pathaan to die in Russia, wasn't she already aware of the kind of work Jim was doing? Clearly Jim did not acquire 'Raktbeej' to create a cure for some disease, so why did she help him instead of Pathaan? I guess, not everyone who works for the intelligence services is that intelligent.Right from the time this movie was announced, I was quite pleased to know that John Abraham would be the antagonist in this film, and after watching the film I have to say that John exceeded my expectations. As an actor, John Abraham has a very limited range but his physical presence and the swag with which he carries himself are attributes that make him the perfect candidate to play the role of Jim. In the movie he is the villain, but I am glad that they gave him a solid backstory, as an explanation to why he is the way he is, because that adds so much more weight to a character. Having a multidimensional anti-hero or a villain who is as smart and powerful as the hero is rare in Hindi movies these days, so for that the creators of this film deserve to be appreciated. John Abraham should aim for more roles like this instead of doing movies like Satyamev Jayate. John looked great in this film and it's quite amazing to see the kind of physique he has maintained at the age of 50.The comedy in the film was good in some parts with jokes that actually landed but felt forced in other places. I really liked the self-depreciating humour involved in the conversation between Tiger and Pathaan. The sequence with Tiger and Pathaan wasn't really a surprise, thanks to the internet, but a good one nonetheless; the special effects however should have been better in that scene.The action sequences in the film were choreographed very well. Pathaan as a top tier secret agent is expected to have some special skills and the stunts that he performs in the movie are extremely good. Typical fight sequences have become so boring that I just feel like fast forwarding them every single time, but I am glad that the stunt choreographers of Pathaan tried to be creative and designed them so well that you just don't want to look away from the screen. The fight scenes during Pathaan's introduction and in the Russian train are absolutely fantastic.Shahrukh Khan is a wonderful actor and it's always a joy to watch him on screen, it's just that the kind of movies he often ends up doing are not quite good. Although, Shahrukh acted very well as Pathaan, I feel these kind of roles are more suited to the likes of Hrithik Roshan and John Abraham. Shahrukh should aim for more character oriented roles that challenge the actor inside him and allow him to tap the massive acting potential he possesses. The love that almost every Indian has for Shahrukh has translated into unprecedented success for Pathaan, but if I just talk about the movie from an objective point of view then it's just an average movie that couldn't offer me the excitement and entertainment that I was hoping for.

      "Rank 5: Directed by Siddharth Anand starring Shah Rukh Khan Deepika Padukone John AbrahamAn out an out Entertainer...Once a King always a King, SRK proved once again that why he is the King of Bollywood...He one of his interviews stated that am here to rule & yes its true....SRK is back 🔥🔥🔥🔥Positivity of the Movie...1) SRK introduction followed by the action sequence was just goosebumps moment that being delivered..2) SRK who never seen in a full fledge action movie, Pathaan answered. He put his all efforts to make the actions interesting. His swag , his dialogue delivery, i cannot able to take my eyes from him.3) John as the antagonist. He nailed it. His looks, base of the voice while delivering something serious was captivating.4) Deepika performed too well. When glamour is required she done it well, when action required she done well. More than a shadow for the hero, her performance made the audience convinced she was a having a important role in the movie.5) Action sequences was amazing especially climax fight sequence of SRK and John. I just loved it.6) People who have mugged up James Bond and Mission Impossible movies, will feel not unique while watching Pathaan but Siddharth Anand added the ingredients required to entertain the audience.Negativity of the Movie.1) VFX could have been better. In certain action sequence it was quite evident.2) John Abhram screen presence was less. More focus went to SRK and Deepika. The story should jab focused on how John Abhram character plans for the mission etc etc.3) Songs were average.Overall a perfect comeback for King Khan at the box office. (Similarity: 0.6536)\n",
      "Rank 6: The screen play is so horrible, poor pacing and the childish dialogues doesn't help, either. The VFX and CGI in the movie is pathetic, can obviously tell it's SRK's duplicate Ibrahim Qadri who is doing all the stunts. Usually the movies are good in the first half, but here the first half is so bad that you just can't wait for the movie to be over and the less said about the second half, the better.Looks like SRK still hasn't learned anything all these 5 years and still sticking to his usual crap. His fans surely won't find my review helpful, either and will blindly rate this movie but as someone who just went through this abomination of a movie, it's my job to save people's time and money. (Similarity: 0.6482)\n",
      "Rank 7: Yash Raj Films cashed on the 'Civilian Vs Military' hysteria of their neighbouring country and produced a film which heavily relied on the charisma of ShahRukh Khan & massy cameo of superstar Salman Khan, who reprised his role from Tiger franchise.If you're looking for a depth or traditional spy genre movie, then Pathan is not your cup of tea, It's plain and predictable with the brand of cinema you have already seen in many Bollywood films especially when they integrated \"Pakistan\" as their nemesis.John Abraham played \"Jim\" an ex Raw officer, who turned into a monster after a he lost his wife and children during a mission. He blamed Raw and turned havoc over his motherland adjoining Pakistani general \"Qadir\" carbonated from the ex COAS General Qamar Javed Bajwa, then Raw/JOCR turned to \"Pathan\" who was exiled purposely after he messed up a mission in Russia. Abraham got some depth and his presence was felt through first half after that his character lost depth and he became predictable.Khan played Pathan, the man with no roots, his character was not justified though SRK aced whatever the script offered him. He was massy, witty and grimacing brilliant as Pathan, which never connected to his ancestral roots which I imagined before the release of the film.Deepika played an ISI agent, totally distorting the \"Islamic Republic\" image of Pakistan. Though Rubina/Rubai was a fictional character but it was trash to reality specifically when they linked it to a Pakistani woman. They disgraced the honor of Pakistani woman brilliantly.Mass factor of the film was Salman Khan cameo as Tiger, he owned Khan for a sequence, totally outshines SRK for a while. It was great to see, both khan's lighting the screen with hotness and swagger.Don't expect something marvellous, the movie will never disappoint you! (Similarity: 0.6448)\n",
      "Rank 8: Pathaan is a mashup of old style Hollywood spy movies. The virus, the vault, rogue agent, Hot female lead etc you name it everything is there. Only thing missing was uniqueness in treatment.Anyways jokes aside I am not at all convinced by the title of the movie as Pathaan. Shahrukh does nothing that shows he is a Pathaan. Even the backstory is very abrupt and seems convinient which adds no emotional angle at all. The movie tries to get from one plot to another without really building up on anything. Siddharth Anand's prime focus is action he is not bothered why it's done or how it's done. It's clearly visible that the Dubai fight sequence with John is done infront of green screen the backround looked like a poster. The train sequence when it starts the whole background looks like cheap animation even the water in the river is still no flow at all. I can go on and on and on about poor vfx some are at Adipurush level if you look at it. Shahrukh should have insisted on practical effects.Siddharth can you please answer why every action piece needs to be at impossible level. Even video games are believable. It's not that hard to make an action sequence difficult and believable at the same time. Looking at Pathaan I felt Marvel movies were still believable given the circumstances. I am not even talking about loopholes which were plenty.Coming to acting and screen presence John Abraham completely steals the show as he is given almost all of the best lines and he delivers them like a pro. He never looked so handsome, most dashing villian ever. Not convinced by his background story yet you can feel his anger. Clearly he is the best part of the movie, his end could have been better not in an animated Hut please. Dimple Kapadia's role is saved by her acting prowess she is a class act, I feel bad that her character is dead she could have added a lot of value to the franchise. I feel Shahrukh and Deepika only added star value. Their characters need a lot of ground work to connect with audience. Please hire some real foreign actors I guess Russians actors are not expensive. Terrible acting by all RussiansPathaan feels like a movie that wants to show you the destination and forgets that the real magic is the journey. The movie rests on the laurels of huge fandom of its casts. People who have grown up watching Bond movies or mission impossible movies or Bourne trilogy will find it funny. The others have found it entertaining.This is not a movie Shahrukh should be proud of. It's not unique or new or path breaking. It's just run of the mill average spy movie a huge hit in Indian context. Miles to go till we make a real spy movie. I'm going with 6 out of 10 for Pathaan. (Similarity: 0.6427)\n",
      "Rank 9: Watched the movie and it was all waste of time, and money.... Suggest you to not watch such a useless story and acting and plan something better.... In max of the movie they have done overacting and they have copy pasted the scenes from many of the past movies the story to looks same as a south movie i have watched ones so it was completely a worst experience of mine with this movie. Just one thing to say it spoiled my day, time and money.... Hope you guys will stay away to be happy and use ur time for good things, you can watch other movies if you have decided to watch a movie today but not this one.. (Similarity: 0.6391)\n",
      "Rank 10: First things first, suspend your sense of disbelief before you sit to watch this film. Some super creative liberties have been taken to salvage SRK's flagging career. His fan armies may be making a lot of noise around the movie but as a neutral viewer, I found this movie to be just run of the mill heroism cut from the same cloth as Salman Khan's chest thumping macho cinema as seen in the likes of Ek Tha Tiger or Tiger Zinda Hai. Logic is out. It's just visual appeal, bravado laden dialogues and other such massy elements. The hype and hoopla surrounding the movie betrayed the real deal. The movie is all style and totally lacking substance. Beyond a point, such cinema begins to cause heartache. All said and done, the movie does have its high points such as Salman Khan's Tiger character integrations, Ashutosh Rana's acting and John Abraham's svelte looks. Besides that the VFX is low brow, masculinity overboard and a supremely weak storyline and weak writing. It can be watched once on OTT. Not worth the ticket price. (Similarity: 0.6304)\n",
      "Rank 11: Action packed entertainer and a visual treat for not only srk fans but also all action dimension movie lovers. Storyline, dialogues, cinematography, acting, direction, action scenes, all things fit perfectly to create this amazing entertainer. Music is on point. The sprinkles of comedy and humour combined with the unique charm of srk help to elevate overall experience of the movie. But something feels lacking, some stones are left unturned. The movie is unable to connect and satisfy the viewer like typical srk movies do.The level of satisfaction while leaving the theatre is low, unlike other srk movies. The structuring and sequencing of the scenes could have been done in a more better manner. Deepika is just a timepass character and fails to impress. John is \"OK\". Storyline is also pretty straight and simple and lacks real twists and turns to give you that nail biting experience. It almost feels that just because it is srk people are forcing themselves to like the movie. U replace srk with any other star and movie will go down for sure. The director of the movie miserably failed to effectively utilise the asset named srk he had at his disposal.Also originality is at question as many times the movie feels just compilation of scenes from different movies like War, Welcome, Don series, Happy New year, race 2, character M from James bond, Ek tha tiger etc. The emotions are lacking and only action is visible.Overall a one time watch average movie with driving factor srk transformaing it into a hit. (Similarity: 0.6240)\n",
      "Rank 12: If you take a bond film , the bourne series and mission impossible And then add a huge dollop of Bollywood including the song & dance routine and a complete detachment from reality and you're actually left with quite a good bit of entertainmentDon't go with great expectations or you'll be disappointed just go and allow yourself to be entertained and you will beIt's a political international spy story with romance , twists and turns , you're never sure who's on who's side or who's the real good guys and who are baddies and in typical Bollywood tradition any love scenes are implied rather than graphic - there's no kissing allowed here and certainly no more than that - Bollywood is as conservative as it was 35 years ago when I last watched a Hindi film - sure there were lots of beautiful perfectly formed people staring into each other eyes and getting within an inch of each other but that's where it endsThere's a huge dollop of violence but it's all choreographed and there were families with young children watching it as it's cut for a 12a rating .The positives were the set locations Dubai , Cadiz and Palma looked amazing with all the drone and helicopter shots. Additional scenes in Beirut , Afghanistan, New Delhi , The artic & Antarctic.A lot of spectacular helicopter flying some of which was clearly cgi but added to the action - like Tom Cruise these actors are in their 50s and no doubt need to be incredibly fit to do all those stunts ( not jealous of their six packs at all ! )Controversially some of the story & action takes place in Russia and although the Moscow scenery is spectacular and skyline as impressive as Dubai it felt uncomfortable knowing this was filmed after the invasion of Ukraine coinciding with the script emphasising the importance of Russia as an ally of India and not wanting to upset them - that didn't feel comfortable as no doubt the fact the script and plot brings up the sensitive subject of Kashmir which will no doubt not sit comfortably with all. There didn't seem to be any Sikh actors either .The main female star and potential love interest of the good guy and bad buy was played by the stunning danish born ex badminton player Deepika Padukone who kind of reminded me of the character played by Catherine Zeta Jones in Entrapment in many ways from costume to location to plot .If this had been a Hollywood movie the budget needed would be well in excess of $100m so the producers deserve credit for making it for the equivalent of $30m . The sound was amazing and music added so much to the entertainment if you're able to detach yourself the couple of times they break into song .Overall a good piece of entertainment that actually has you on the edge of the seat touches your emotions and being a smile to your face and a sense of completion and achievement.If you don't see it on the cinema you'll catch in on amazon prime it's inspired me to want to watch more Bollywood.Don't worry about the subtitles as probably about 30% of the dialogue was in English even when you least expected it half way through a sentence in Hindi the characters break into English which took a bit of getting used to.EnjoyablePad.

Those who've seen 007 movies in the 90s would agree that this is just an Hindi version of Bond movies made by Hollywood in the past 2-3 decades... The fight scene on truck-top in the earlier part of the movie looked more like drama than action. There was no logic in about 30% of the movie. Well you cannot expect logic where there are ShahRukh and Salman. That's where much criticized Amir Khan stands apart. Overall the movie is one-time watch even for the fans of stars in this film. Stunts in the train-fight was well directed untill Salman Khan showed up. (Similarity: 0.6141)\n",

The movie starts with a grand entry of SRK and then is handed to now very experienced hands of John to take the audience by surprise.

John Abraham returns back to his lovable villanious form that he once donned in Dhoom. Deepika's role was well written and no her on screen presence was not just limited to some item numbers but was actually crafted for a solo lead for another YRF Spy Verse movie which I am sorry to say that Katrina's character of Zoya in Tiger franchise terribly lacks. Won't be surprising if Deepika gets her own Black Widow kinda movie and team YRF should definitely think about it.Overall a very entertaining movie filled with grand scale action sequences and with lot of inner jokes from Bollywood on Bollywood.Note - The fans from middle east are in for a surprise at the end, when Jhoome Jo Pathaan song is played.

      "worstAb war 2 mat lana.The film is not good.The movie seems to be a bit of Chimera made of several movies put together - Gadar, Tiger and Hero Panti series.It was mostly chapri crowd in the theatre hooting , clapping and shouting and then there were loads of \"not so excited folks\" like me given the movie's story line.Guess, I may have been looking at much better story but then what works for the masses is what gains traction it seems.My suggestion to someone not wanting to watch brainless fighting scenes, they could avoid the movie. (Similarity: 0.5969)\n",
      "Rank 20: What do you get when you have Ethan Hunt in mind but a \"Rahul\" as the lead actor you get a goofy, almost childish like character who dances, romances and bores you to death.This is almost like those parody movies Hollywood produces for the blockbusters except the makes themselves too seriously and try to make you think like they are seasoned filmmakera who knows what they are doing. Same old plot, same old antagonists , same old humour with a subtle propaganda this time.An ex RAW agent creates a Terrorist group and tries to destroy India. I mean have you lost all sense of reality!!!. And an ISI agent works with Pathaan to save India. Wow *sarcastic claps* (Similarity: 0.5812)\n",
      "Rank 21: This film is all about entertainment. A little bit slower first half but the second half covers up everything and my o my what a climax. I just loved watching the film n now looking forward to watch it again on IMAX screen. The film has a proper story, interesting execution and long action sequences, most specially SRK's hand to hand combat sequences. BGM is also good. Dipika has done a good and John, wow he soaked up his character so brilliantly, his dialogues and evil mind-set makes u hate him more. SRK is back baby and he is back in a monstrous way. A very big thumbs up for pathaan. All the very best. (Similarity: 0.5797)\n",
      "Rank 22: Worst movie ever made by over hyped SRK. He done only 10% work in this movie and remaining 90% was done by body double. Film makers copied all the action scene from hollywood even copied from south movies. Now this is high time we should understand that bollywood doesn't know how to direct the original movies and keep the good stories up to the standards. Drishyam is a hit series of bollywood but still copied from south movies. Bollywood is become senseless and can not survive on their own with out copying movies. Bollywood means garbagewood. Please save your money and spend on something better. (Similarity: 0.5722)\n",
      "Rank 23: 20 years back movies used to have content and acting but now a days only big old age actors want to create nonsense just to earn money.Acting is totally pathetic. Story line is very simple and VFX are totally disappointed.There are more better movies on OTT now a days like Gullak and Panchayat which are much better than these nonsense movies.These nonsense old age actors must stop acting and start doing some other job.People are fed up with this kinda of repeated nonsense.I will have to now watch some OTT series to make my mood. This movie have proved why 99% Bollywood movies are failing. (Similarity: 0.5720)\n",
      "Rank 24: This would have been a great films with such sting cast and big budget.SRK is just following the trends I guess make a movie like marvel with good VFX and keep comedy lines in dialogue so that people find it funny and think of you as tony stark.I mean seriously the dialogue's were so childish. The movie was even very predictable with a climax that was just the most disappointing part of itI gave this movie 3 stars coz of John Abraham who's character is quite interesting and makes the movie tolerable to watchThis movie needed to take inspiration from Baby and mission impossible franchise. (Similarity: 0.5661)\n",
      "Rank 25: Film is copy of multiple James bond movies Like sky fall Jim(Jhon Abraham charector is copied from Skyfall Rogue Silva,And Dimple kapadia Is also copied from James bond M ,it was expected From sidharth Anand from Utter disappointed by Watching hollywood copy of Bang bang ,war now pathan, Dimple kapadia is Highly inspired by M of James bond movies ,I don't know why bollywood only need to copy and paste the movies,VFX work is poor some times body double found is clearly visible, Close-up shots are good a typical bollywood masala for only SRK fans not for ordinary audience ,If you are not introduced to hollywood then only watch this copied work from other flicks like and stupid stunt Man flying without mask with the help of glider.
